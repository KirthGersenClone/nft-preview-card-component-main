## Things learned

The excercise I did before this one, I positioned an icon over an inputfield by using position absolute and relative. This excersise I used :: before. I look for solutions on the web and 90% of the time I and up watching a video made by Kevin Powell.

Thanks to the website W3schools I learned how opacity works, and I used that gathered knowledge in my solution.

## Grid and Flex

Before this excercise I read a lot about flex and grid, and I even learned a chapter in a college syllabus about grid. But I ran into the same problem as before, I can not seem to find the right way to center an element on a page. But finaly it hit me, and now I am confidend that next excercise will give me no more headaches on the subject.
